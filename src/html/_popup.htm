						More and more modern people prefer to lead a healthy lifestyle: in particular, eat right, diet,
						exercise.
						However, in the rapid rhythm of days, it is the issue of complete and proper nutrition that becomes
						not
						the easiest to implement. This is due to the fact that a person often does not want to spend time on
						cooking, preferring semi-finished products and canned food; seizes the feeling of hunger with fast
						food,
						fatty and sweet foods; not attentive to the choice of products and does not think about what food is
						healthy and what is not. In addition, not everyone manages to drink at least 1.5-2 liters of pure
						water
						daily, which helps normal metabolism and cleanse the body of toxins.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, changing the habitual food culture and regime becomes a certain barrier that must be
						overcome.
						But this always gives a positive result associated with the improvement of the body, improved
						well-being,
						weight loss. There is another argument - tasty healthy food gives a feeling of joy in life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Principles of healthy eating <br>
						The formula for proper, healthy nutrition is quite simple, as it includes only two components that are
						directly dependent on each other. Its essence is as follows: the energy value of food (measured in
						calories) must correspond to the energy expenditure of the body. Everyone knows that if a person eats
						a
						lot, but moves little, his unspent energy turns into excess weight. This means that in maintaining a
						normal weight, lifestyle, occupation, gender, physiological data, and physical activity matter. But
						each
						person can follow simple rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, proper, that is, balanced or rational, nutrition requires:
					</p>
					<p>
						observe the regime, there is always at the same time; <br>
						stick to a meal schedule: breakfast, light snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner. In this case, the
						main
						amount of food should be ingested during breakfast and lunch; <br>
						take a break between meals no more than 3 hours; <br>
						take into account the energy value of products and correctly distribute them in the nutrition
						schedule; <br>
						calculate the volume of a serving of food, observing the "plate rule": 1/4 - complex carbohydrates,
						1/4 -
						proteins, 1/2 - vegetables, fruits, berries; <br>
						combine fats, proteins and carbohydrates according to personal physical activity, do not forget about
						vitamins, trace elements, fiber; <br>
						give preference to vegetables and fruits, fish, poultry, lean meats, seafood, low-fat dairy products,
						legumes, whole grains, cereals; <br>
						reduce the use of salt, sugar, sweets and pastries (fast carbohydrates), carbonated drinks, factory
						juices, alcohol; <br>
						adhere to healthy cooking methods: steaming, stewing, boiling; <br>
						include nutritional supplements and dietary supplements in the diet; <br>
						eat only when you feel hungry; do not eat too cold and too hot food; chew thoroughly; <br>
						try to have dinner before 18-19 hours; <br>
						sleep at least 7 hours a day, avoid stress.
					</p>
					<p>
						how to switch to a healthy diet? <br>
						To maintain a normal weight, feel comfortable and the overall well-being of the body, it is worth
						considering a menu for every day, which is usually called a light diet for every day. A balanced diet
						should be compiled individually, for one day or a week. Its goal is nutritional balance, that is, the
						ratio of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, close to 1 - 1 - 4, which helps the body to fully digest food
						and
						thus be enriched with the necessary substances. So, protein gives satiety, fats and carbohydrates -
						energy. We must not forget that a diet and physical activity that is optimal for age and health status
						bring double benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						The use of nutritional supplements and dietary supplements also plays an important role in maintaining
						health and normal weight. So Amway offers useful products included in the Bodykey and BodyDetox
						programs.
